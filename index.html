                <div class="panel">
                    <p>5 years ago,International Child Nutrition received some complaints about School lunches in
                        children schools and we treated the subject with the importance it deserved through the
                        passage
                        of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In doing so, we reached out to experts, and we said,
                        "Tell
                        us what we need to do, particularly as it relates to those meals where some youngsters in
                        America
                        today receive a third or a half of the calories that they take in during the school year."
                        The
                        experts came back and said, "Your school lunches, your school snacks, there's too much
                        sugar.
                        There's too much sodium. There's too much fat. You need to promote more fruits and
                        vegetables,
                        low-fat dairy, and whole grains. You need to have a consistent message in your school snack
                        program with what you're doing in school meals. You need to expand access to school
                        breakfast,
                        and you need to frankly make it a little bit easier in those school districts where there is
                        a
                        significantly high number of free and reduced-lunch kids for everyone to have access to a
                        good
                        meal. And over the course of the last several years, we've seen, I think, significant
                        acceptance
                        of these standards, 95 percent of schools certified under the new standards, and it's not
                        just
                        school districts certified. It's also an acceptance in the general public. Based on recent
                        surveys, up to 90 percent of the American public believes it's appropriate to have
                        standards,
                        federal standards, national standards for our schools and school meals.</p>

                    <p>We can’t end hunger if we don’t end conflict We’ve been through some rough months, we had
                        nothing in
                        the house — no furniture, no food and no money. Sometimes, I stay out late for work and when
                        I come
                        home I never wake the children up. If I woke them up, they would say they wanted to eat
                        dinner.”

                        been
                        ravaging his country since 2015. Like him, hundreds of millions of people around the world
                        are being
                        pushed into hunger and destitution by war and armed violence.</p>
