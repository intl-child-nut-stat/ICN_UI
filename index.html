                    <p>International Child Nutrition, developed through an educational grant from the Academy of
                        Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation, aims to be the practitioner’s go-to site for open-access to
                        relevant and effective international nutrition education materials. Currently, you will find
                        materials here focused on Central America, including: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Background information on key nutrition-related topics in Central America, including how to
                            explain health and nutrition concepts to this population.</li>
                        <li>Educational illustrations to help teach these key nutrition-related topics in Central
                            America.</li>
                        <li>A collection of food illustrations and nutrient comparison charts unique to the local food
                            supply of Central America.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Illustrations are available in color and black and white outline versions for ease of printing.
                        Suggested use is printing the desired illustrations and laminating them prior to international
                        travel as computer and printer availability is often unreliable at the destination.</p>
                    <p>Internation Child Nutrition was supported by the Academy of Nutrition and
                        Dietetics Foundation's Wimpfheimer-Guggenheim Fund for International Exchange in Nutrition,

                    <p>5 years ago,International Child Nutrition received some complaints about School lunches in
                        children schools and we treated the subject with the importance it deserved through the passage
                        of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. In doing so, we reached out to experts, and we said, "Tell us
                        what we need to do, particularly as it relates to those meals where some youngsters in America
                        today receive a third or a half of the calories that they take in during the school year." The
                        experts came back and said, "Your school lunches, your school snacks, there's too much sugar.
                        There's too much sodium. There's too much fat. You need to promote more fruits and vegetables,
                        low-fat dairy, and whole grains. You need to have a consistent message in your school snack
                        program with what you're doing in school meals. You need to expand access to school breakfast,
                        and you need to frankly make it a little bit easier in those school districts where there is a
                        significantly high number of free and reduced-lunch kids for everyone to have access to a good
                        meal. And over the course of the last several years, we've seen, I think, significant acceptance
                        of these standards, 95 percent of schools certified under the new standards, and it's not just
                        school districts certified. It's also an acceptance in the general public. Based on recent
                        surveys, up to 90 percent of the American public believes it's appropriate to have standards,
                        federal standards, national standards for our schools and school meals.</p>
